# Contributing to Sota
Below is just a zero approximation of proper contribution guidelines. Will be updated if needed.

To build Sota from sources either as GDExtension or module see [doc](docs/content/getting_started/build.md)

## Workflow
* Please use existing [Godot pull request workflow](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/workflow/pr_workflow.html)
* Check guidelines related to [Types Abstraction Layer](docs/content/arch/tal.md)


## Code style
There are no well-defined rules yet, but please:
1. Apply clang-format before making pull request. Configuration file is in root directory.
2. Stick to [Cpp Core Guildelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).
3. If you are hesitant, check [Best practices (godot)](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/best_practices_for_engine_contributors.html) and [Godot C++ usage guidelines](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/cpp_usage_guidelines.html)

## Documentation
See `docs` directory and [read the docs](https://sota.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for online documentation.
